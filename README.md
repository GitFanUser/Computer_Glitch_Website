Computer_Glitch_Website

This was a project from school to make a website to show all the parts of a computer you want to build.

I hoped to build a server (not having a specific type in mind!). I researched the different parts, and tried to include the most expensive parts that I could have include.

Please run the html file named ```ComputerStudies_glitch_website.htm``` to view the website.

It is a very simple website (rather very bad styling and css!), which is made from scratch using html, css, and javascript. No back-end for the website.
